          <h3>Doggy Bag Distillery</h3>
          <p>Doggy Bag Distillery is the first gin worldwide to be produced by using food waste only. Founded by a group of
            attentive
            students who have chosen to innovate gin in a way that has never been thought before. They decided to produce this
            beverage by using food which would otherwise be disposed of by local restaurants. Since they are at the very beginning
            of their startup, we have been hired by them for analysing their market opportunities and for helping them in their
            general marketing efforts.</p>
