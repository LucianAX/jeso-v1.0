      <h3>"Learning by doing"</h3>
      <p>This is the motto of all Junior Enterprises around the world. The core idea of the Junior Enterprise concept is to make
      a link between higher education and the business field. The students active in a Junior Enterprise get to apply their
      academic skills in real contexts while companies get smaller projects done and can access the talent base bringing new
      perspectives into their organisations. Most Junior Enterprises are organised similar to real consulatancy companies with
      the main difference that in a JE there are only students working and, because it is a non.profit organisation, the
      students will not get paid but the money earned is only used for matters of the organisation itself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The first Junior Enterprise was established in France in 1967. Since then the JE Europe Network has expanded in 14
      European countries, where 30,000 students have joined. The network already finished more than 5,300 consulting projects
      across various industries. JESO is a Junior Initiative from Denmark, which was initiated by Sybille Petit (an exchange
      student from ICHEC Junior Consult - a JE in Brussels) in October 2019. This makes JESO the first Junior Initiative in
      Denmark and now we are in the process of becoming a member of the JE Europe Network and hence an official JE. If we
      succeed JESO will be together with JECO (a Junior Enterprise in Copenhagen) the first JE in Denmark and therefore
      expanding the network to a new country.
      
      The larger, global network is active in 44 countries, has 51,000 students and comprises more than 360 offices in Europe,
      more than 600 in Brazil and dozens in the U.S.</p>
