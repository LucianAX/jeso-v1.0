          <h3>Claas Lienhard Klatte</h3>
          <h4>President</h4>
        </div>
        <p>I am from Hamburg, Germany and I am a fifth semester Engineering, Innovation and Business student at SDU. Besides my
        interest in technology and engineering my mind is the mind of an Entrepreneur. I love thinking about new ideas and ways
        of implementing them and founding this organisation together with my fellow students is in my opinion one of the best
        ways to get the first experience with Entrepreneurship and Project Management.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I am a third semester Polish student studying Economics and Business Administration at University of Southern Denmark.
        As a business student, I am always trying to find ways of gaining experience in the field, and founding a Junior
        Enterprise is a perfect opportunity to learn and make a difference. I love meeting new people and working together to
        reach a common goal.</p>

          <h4>Treasurer</h4>
        </div>
        <p>My name is Barbora Peťková and I'm a student of BSc Economics and business administration at SDU in Sonderborg. I have a
        passionate interest in my field of study, especially in economics. I chose to dedicate my time to consulting, since it
        is a way to apply the knowledge to the real-life practice. I have participated in several projects with focus on
        innovation for businesses. Besides that I am managing a student foundation, so I enjoy taking responsibility and a
        project work. I would describe myself as an outgoing, organized and enthusiastic person.</p>

        <p>I’m Alegreta, I am from Italy and I’m currently studying Economics and Business Administration. I believe that this
        academic path is allowing me to grow further in a personal and professional level. I’ve been living and traveling by
        myself for many years and this great opportunity gave me the chance to meet people coming from every corner of the
        world, implementing in me an international insight of the world and a good capability to openly communicate with
        everyone. I’m delighted to take part of JESO and make the best out of this unique experience.</p>
